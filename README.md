# HateSpeech-Classification-in-Text
Applied different classification algorithms for classifying hate speech and offensive speech on tweets

First stopwords are removed and preprocessing is done on text.
Then POS festures are extracted and stored along with text in data frame.
Convert all these features into array.
Convert string label or class into integer.
Note that above operations are applied on both train and test file of the data set.
Data set I used is HasocTrack Fire English Database.

Then  SVM,Logistic regression,Random Forests and  Naive bayes classifier is applied.
After that CNN model is implemented.
